## 3.3 Hub-and-Spoke: Coordinator and Subagents

A multi-agent architecture is typically built as a hub-and-spoke topology:

```
         Coordinator
        /     |      \
   Subagent1  Subagent2  Subagent3
    (search)   (analysis)   (synthesis)
```

**The coordinator is responsible for:**
- Decomposing the task into subtasks
- Deciding which subagents are needed (dynamic selection)
- Delegating work to subagents
- Aggregating and validating results
- Handling errors and retries
- Communicating results to the user

**Critical principle: subagents have isolated context.**
- Subagents do **not** automatically inherit the coordinator's conversation history
- All required context must be **explicitly passed** in the subagent prompt
- Subagents do not share memory across calls
- All communication flows through the coordinator (for observability and error control)

## 3.4 The `Task` Tool for Spawning Subagents

Subagents are spawned via the `Task` tool:

```python
# The coordinator's allowedTools must include "Task"
coordinator_agent = AgentDefinition(
    allowed_tools=["Task", "get_customer"]
)
```

**Explicit context passing is mandatory:**

```
# Bad: the subagent has no context
Task: "Analyze the document"

# Good: full context in the prompt
Task: "Analyze the following document.
Document: [full document text]
Prior search results: [web search results]
Output format requirements: [schema]"
```

**Parallel spawning:** a coordinator can call multiple `Task`s in one response—subagents run in parallel:

```
# One coordinator response contains:
Task 1: "Search for articles about X"
Task 2: "Analyze document Y"
Task 3: "Search for articles about Z"
# All three run concurrently
```

## 3.5 Hooks in the Agent SDK

Hooks allow interception and transformation at specific points in the agent lifecycle.

**PostToolUse** intercepts a tool result before it is provided to the model:

```python
# Example: normalize date formats from different MCP tools
@hook("PostToolUse")
def normalize_dates(tool_result):
    # Convert Unix timestamp -> ISO 8601
    # Convert "Mar 5, 2025" -> "2025-03-05"
    return normalized_result
```

**Outgoing-call interception hook** blocks actions that violate policy:

```python
# Example: block refunds above $500
@hook("PreToolUse")
def enforce_refund_limit(tool_call):
    if tool_call.name == "process_refund" and tool_call.args.amount > 500:
        return redirect_to_escalation(tool_call)
```

**Key difference: hooks vs prompt instructions**

| Attribute | Hooks | Prompt instructions |
|---|---|---|
| Guarantee | **Deterministic** (100%) | **Probabilistic** (>90%, not 100%) |
| When to use | Critical business rules, financial operations, compliance | General preferences, recommendations, formatting |
| Example | Block refunds > $500 | "Try to solve before escalating" |

**Rule:** when failure has financial, legal, or safety consequences—use hooks, not prompts.

## After reading, do:
1. For **Scenario 1: Customer Support Agent**, list 3 rules that should be hooks (not prompt text) — with reasoning.
2. Write the "explicit context" version of a prompt to a `research_subagent` delegated from a coordinator.
3. Answer **Practice Test** questions 1–5 in `claude-certified-architect/practical_test_en.html`. Log any you're unsure about.
4. End-of-week review: re-skim `NOTES.md` and circle topics to revisit in Week 3.
