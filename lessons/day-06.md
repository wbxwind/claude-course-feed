# Chapter 3: Claude Agent SDK — Building Agentic Systems

> Documentation: [Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) | [Hooks](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/hooks) | [Subagents](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/subagents) | [Sessions](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/sessions)

## 3.1 What is an Agentic Loop

The agentic loop is the core pattern for autonomous task execution. The model doesn't just answer—it performs a sequence of actions:

```
1. Send a request to Claude with tools
2. Receive a response
3. Check stop_reason:
   - "tool_use" -> execute the tool, append the result to history, go back to step 1
   - "end_turn" -> the task is complete, show the result to the user
4. Repeat until completion
```

**This is a model-driven approach:** Claude decides which tool to call next based on context and prior tool results. This differs from hard-coded decision trees where the action sequence is fixed.

**Anti-patterns (avoid):**
- Parsing assistant text to detect completion ("Task completed")
- Using an arbitrary iteration limit (e.g., `max_iterations=5`) as the primary stop condition
- Checking whether the assistant produced textual content as a completion signal

**Correct approach:** the only reliable completion signal is `stop_reason == "end_turn"`.

## 3.2 `AgentDefinition` Configuration

`AgentDefinition` is the agent configuration object in the Claude Agent SDK:

```python
agent = AgentDefinition(
    name="customer_support",
    description="Handles customer requests for returns and order issues",
    system_prompt="You are a customer support agent...",
    allowed_tools=["get_customer", "lookup_order", "process_refund", "escalate_to_human"],
    # For a coordinator:
    # allowed_tools=["Task", "get_customer", ...]
)
```

**Key parameters:**
- `name` / `description` — identification and description of the agent
- `system_prompt` — system prompt with instructions
- `allowed_tools` — list of allowed tools (principle of least privilege)

---

## After reading, do:
1. On paper (or in a diagram app), draw the agentic loop and label the `stop_reason` branches.
2. Write one concrete example where an iteration limit as a stop signal would cause bugs.
3. Draft an `AgentDefinition` for a made-up "invoice processor" agent. Give it 3–4 narrow `allowed_tools`.
4. Log confusions in `NOTES.md`.
